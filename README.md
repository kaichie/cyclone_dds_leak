## Dependencies

Tested on `iron`.

1. Install FastDDS and CycloneDDS
1. Install `tmuxinator`: `sudo apt install tmuxinator`
1. Probably install python dependencies if you want to plot :) `pip install -f requirements.txt`

## How to run?

Run the experiments, come with `tmux` session to see what's going on, wait and see the results :)

```
bash ./run_experiment.sh
```
